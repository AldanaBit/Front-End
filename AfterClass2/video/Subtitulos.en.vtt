00:04.400 --> 00:10.940  
How do you find a creature that can camouflage into any background?  

00:10.940 --> 00:16.079  
They are the most mysterious creatures on Earth.  

00:16.079 --> 00:21.920  
They are geniuses,  

00:21.920 --> 00:23.500  
(No text for this time)  

00:26.560 --> 00:27.820  
cambiaformas.  

00:31.200 --> 00:34.166  
They are incredibly alien, and,  

00:34.166 --> 00:34.760  
yet  

00:34.760 --> 00:37.820  
more similar to us than we could have ever imagined.  

00:42.050 --> 00:46.212  
They have as much curiosity about you as you do about them.  

00:46.212 --> 00:48.760  
It just felt like magic.  

00:55.020 --> 01:00.760  
Every encounter with an octopus feels like a truly intimate moment.  

01:10.360 --> 01:12.200  
What else do they have to tell us?
